  <content><![CDATA[<p>The Aubergine starter kit, is the latest evolution of the Local Gov Starter kit for Umbraco, used by 1000s of people to get started and build their Umbraco sites.</p>
<p>Aubergine takes all the goodies in the Local Gov Starter kit gives them a polish for the latest version of umbraco, and adds some cool extra stuff to give you not only a starting point for your site, but a platform of tools and add ones to take it to the next level.</p>
<h4>Umbraco 7.6</h4>
<p>The aubergine starter kit has been built to take advantage of all the goodies that Umbraco 7.6 can deliver. </p>
<h4>NuGet all the things</h4>
<p>With the aubergine starter kit, we have endeavoured to make everything installable via NuGet. Installing packages via NuGet means your visual studio project always contains all the information needed to get your site up and running, and it makes deploying your site to a server easier. </p>
