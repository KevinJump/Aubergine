Aubergine Forums 
================

Default views ::

This folder contains the default views for forums. 

If you want to alter or override these just copy them to: 

	/Views/Partials (so you have /Views/Partials/Forums/)

That is eariler in teh search path for razor views so will
take presedence over the views in this folder - and that
way you don't have to worry about loosing changes if you 
upgade the forums package later on.
