Aubergine Comments
==================

This folder contains the default partial views for 
comments. 

If yoy want to alter these views first copy them 
to \views\partials (so you have \views\partials\comments)

the partials in that folder will be found first and 
used in place of the ones in this folder. and it will
mean you don't have to worry about loosing any of your
changes during an upgrade of this package.
