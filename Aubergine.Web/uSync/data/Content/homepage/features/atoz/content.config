  <content><![CDATA[<p>Aubergine includes an A to Z page, that lets visitors see your site based on the letter.</p>
<p>Most of the time this isn't a great way to navigate around a website, but if people know what they are looking for then it can cut short the browsing around the site because they will find things quickly</p>
<p>The A to Z also shows you how you can use the Cache to manage and return what would ordinarly be a slow query very quickly. </p>
<p>When the first user asks for an A to Z page - The AtoZ helper classes go and build the whole a to z for the site which can be slow, and put it into the cache. then when anyone else visits an A to Z page the results are served from the cache.</p>
<p>An Application Event Handler then hooks into Umbraco publish and unpublish events - so when a piece of content is published (or unpublished) the atoz caches are cleared meaning they will always match what is published in umbraco.</p>
